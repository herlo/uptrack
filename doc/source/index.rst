Welcome to Uptrack's documentation!
***********************************

Uptrack was started at `Network Box`_, as an effort to get a global overview
of our custom Linux distribution: it is based mostly on Enterprise Linux, with
additional packages coming from Fedora or our own in-house developments, and
as a result we need to track how close to our upstream we are.

Uptrack provides at a quick glance an overview of the package freshness in the
various distribution releases.
